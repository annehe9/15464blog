### February 22nd, 2021 | Lecture 5
I arrived a little late to lecture today from my previous class running over,
but I did get to hear a few people's project ideas which was nice. I am planning
on comparing keyframing with mocap animation.

It was interesting to get a closer look at RigNet today. I agree that the skeleton structure
was a bit unconventional with the shoulder bones offset from a more central joint,
 but if they provided the data themselves maybe this is
intentional and leads to the improvement over existing methods? 

The skinning was impressive in how it was able to 
differentiate between many layers and weight separate flowing sections of fabric.
I liked that this paper emphasized that it was designed for
practical use in real time applications.
It seems like research methods are usually implemented in external programs separately
after the paper has been published, so it was cool that they mentioned
it is already in use in game engines.

Neural networks are clearly very powerful in graphics and animation. I am curious about the
process of designing these neural networks, i.e. how do they decide how to 
construct them/what transforms and units to include,
 and how do they preprocess the data.

It was nice to go over quaternions and dual quaternions to solidify my understanding of them,
and take a brief look at cage skinning as well.
