Cool to see the SIGGRAPH 2021 papers that are coming up. GANs seem to be pretty popular in graphics research for transferring certain styles or properties from a reference to another ouput.
Overall the results looked very realistic. I agree that the foot motion and contact is not so convincing and there are more complicated joints that should govern the foot contact. 

I understand how these models are trained on data but it still kind of seems like magic to me. I don't like that neural networks are inherently a black box on what they determine as correct or more strongly weighted.

It was interesting to see MPM used for hair, I haven't seen it used for anything similar to this. Maybe because their ASFLIP method is just much better at handling this than existing models.

The wildfire paper seems very practical for predicting the effects and how to control wildfires. I guess there's not an ethical way to verify if their model is accurate, but I would like to know what they input for the simulation and how they handle diverse environmentav factors.

The infinite domain paper was pretty impressive and the demos were cool. It seems like it might still be computationally expensive.

It's always fun to see how computers discover human actions and dynamics using physical properties, so the high jump paper was pretty entertaining.

I wasn't really sure what they meant by 4D on the garment paper. I am familiar with the short row technique mentioned and agree that its very good at shaping around a 3D area and allowing for more targeted elasticity.
