### February 3rd, 2021 | Lecture 2
Cool lecture going over the different processes used to create animation. It is interesting how, even with modern methods of generating animation or capturing movement, the core concepts developed in traditional animation still guide the standards and expectations for character animation.
I also enjoyed learning about mocap today, which I did not have much knowledge about prior to this course. It was cool to see the work CMU is doing in this field. Hopefully we can cover this topic in greater depth later in the course, particularly how to process and use mocap data. This might be helpful for doing my final project if I choose to do something related to character animation.
