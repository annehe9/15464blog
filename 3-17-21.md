I enjoyed hearing the second round of paper presentations on cloth and collisions.

Zoltan presented on "A Bending Model for Nodal Discretizations of Yarn-Level Cloth". I find the area of yarn-level cloth very interesting as someone who makes garments. 
It was cool to see how to represent the bending of yarn-level cloth. I wish Zoltan could have gone into more depth in his presentation about the background or explained more about how the cloth was able to retain the creases using this model, since this seemed like the primary result.

Emma presented on "A Safe and Fast Repulsion Method for GPU-based Cloth Self-Collisions". I thought it was interesting to learn about about recent animation research from a hardware perspective. I see how this could be useful in reaching real-time simulation of cloth collision for interesting mechanics in games or something.

Zhengyang presented "Adaptive Merging for Rigid Body Simulation". The merging idea that this paper aimed to resolve seemed very intuitive and presented an interesting solution of when to consider objects merged or separate. The speedup in results seemed pretty good, though I can see that there can be some tricky cases or cases where it provides less realistic motion.

Aayushya presented "Incremental Potential Contact: Intersection and Inversion-free Large Deformation Dynamics". The results seemed very good and it was able to handle many contacts without intersections or inversions, and it seemed like it was able to handle a wide variety of scenarios.

Max presented "Detailed Rigid Body Simulation with Extended Position Based Dyanmics". It was interesting to see how they represented rigid body particles and the idea of substepping was very compelling.
