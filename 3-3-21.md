Mini project 1 presentations were today! Very cool to see how everyone implemented IK methods and to see some keyframing and motion capture animation. It was nice to see that people shared common experiences with their projects, such as modifying the quaternions of mocap data and otherwise having arbitrary amusing behavior from the mocap animation, and observing the candy wrapper effect live that we mentioned in an earlier lecture. Everyone did a really great job and I enjoyed hearing about everyone's individual experience with implementing different methods of animation.
