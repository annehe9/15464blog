Today we did the third round of paper presentations.
Alice presented "A Practical Octree Liquid Simulator with Adaptive Surface Resolution". I thought it was interesting that it did not require diagonal neighbor connectivity and that this could make fluid simulation more efficient in terms of memory access.
Po presented "Surface-Only Ferrofluids". It was interesting to consider fluid that is influenced by an additional magnetic field. The particle and surface-mesh representation makes sense for this kind of fluid given its behavior and its lack of splashing or separation. The results look very good and I look forward to future improvements on the efficiency of the method.
Ryan Z. presented "A Model for Soap Film Dynamics with Evolving Thickness". I've always been intrigued by the phenomena of thin film interference and it seems very nontrivial to simulate the motion of the patterns along a thin film, especially on a 3D mesh like a bubble that can be affected by forces like wind. It makes sense that this is resolved by introducing a thickness term.
Jamie presented "An Implicit Compressible SPH Solver for Snow Simulation". Snow is interesting because it displays different behavior when compressed. I thought the results looked good, they showed a variety of scenarios, and the individual snowflakes were very noticeable.
Hesper presented "On Bubble Rings and Ink Chandeliers". Prior to seeing this paper I didn't know that bubble rings existed but they look very cool. It was interesting to learn that they are the result of a vortex filament. The results were kind of niche but they looked very similar to the reference video, so it was very good at what it was intended to do.
