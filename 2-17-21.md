The line of action paper was very interesting and as someone who enjoys drawing comic-styled traditional art I can see how this would be helfpul in quickly creating dynamic poses.
Gesture drawing posing . I thought it was interesting how they could parse the joints and body parts using the curvature of the stroke, I have never thought about that before.
Also I noticed that all the gesture drawings were of the same model that was eventually posed, I wonder if they could pose using a gesture drawing that was not model-accurate.
Maybe not because they are determining the joints from the silhouette of the drawing.
