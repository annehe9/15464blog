I enjoyed learning about the first paper. It will definitely help guide in creating more realistic behavior for cloth, such as strain, collisions, and friction.
Using repulsive force sounds like a good idea to reduce collision and thus reduce issues with collisions.
It was interesting to learn about Coulomb Friction.
It was cool to see the second paper capture the different behavior of the cloth when rotated. It was cool to see that they accurately captured the properties of the different  materials, although there were some inaccuracies.
I liked the parameters they chose in the Disney paper.
