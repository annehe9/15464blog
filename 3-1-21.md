I keep forgetting to update this blog or forgetting to update the index page. :/ Sorry about that.

Today we covered learned motion matching.
I played TLOU2 so it was interesting to hear about the motion they are using.
As a novice game developer, I do not like the state machine workflow for animating game motion, so I was excited to see an alternate form of controls. 
Primarily, I find it hard to organize and verify the motion, and there are a lot of edges between the states that need to be animated and individually adjusted, so this process is just very tedious.
Posematching would definitely be helpful in this case.
It is cool that they are able to do this without a lot of features in their feature vector, although they do sacrifice the arm and head motions for position accuracy since they search for hip and feet features.
I was very impressed by the speed of the search and would like to look more into the data structure used to optimize this.
I liked learning about inertialization and there was a improvement from blend from pose, it showed the momentum of the character better when transitioning to a new pose.
It was interesting that they were able to store just the features database and not the animation database, and they were able to even further reduce memory used for the combined features database.
