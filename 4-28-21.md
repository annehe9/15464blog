The first paper on dynamic legged locomotion was pretty interesting. I liked the video demo. If there were creatures with that many legs in real life, they moved as I would expect them to move.

It makes sense to divide the movement into a state machine. 
I am curious how they would anticipate ground contact, especially on potentially uneven topology. Or, it would have to be a very fast transition.
