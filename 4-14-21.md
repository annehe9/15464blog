### April 14th, 2021 | Lecture 19

Lots of fun papers covered in today's lecture.

We took a deeper look at the Monster Mash paper. This paper seems reminiscient of some other drawing based inflation and animating papers we have seen,
but it seems better because you can specify the ordering of the joints and they are preserved better than other techniques.
It is interesting how it naturally creates overlapping animation which gives it a more realistic and natural feel,
since I find this difficult to do with traditional 3D animation techniques. Also interesting that it is purely an effect of the geometry convergence and not physics.	

I tried the Monster Mash demo on the website after class and it was pretty fun to use. 

I think it would be fun to try and integrate the ARAP algorithm into a game mechanic. The approach was a nice and fairly straightforward minimization.

I enjoyed learning about the FEM. It helped me get a better understanding of the comparison to the method used in the paper I will be presenting.
