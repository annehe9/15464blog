It was nice to go over the final project expectations and past projects and papers. I found the motion doodles paper very interesting.
Interesting to see that collisions use an instantaneous impulse force. I wonder how they simulate more gradual force and elastic deformation of the object for objects that don't immediately bounce off the surface.
