Today was the Mini Project 2 presentations. I thought everyone did a great job with their projects. Many people did a thorough exploration of cloth simulation, so it was nice to get a thorough understanding of that, see what different aspects of cloth sim people explored, and hear their thoughts and experiences with the project.
Nikolas's project looked very fun. It was impressive how he turned the depth of the live video into spring energy on the surface of the cloth. The velocity smoothing definitely helped reduce noise and artifacts.
Alan's project was also very fun. It worked very well on capturing short, percussive sounds. The large particle size did seem to detract a little from the precision of the simulation, but it's understandable that using more smaller particles would be very computationally expensive.
In real life I think people who design music fountains hard code them instead of processing the sound frequencies, so I think the results were quite good for automatically generating the fountain patterns.
Hesper also did a unique project involving orbiting objects. This was an interesting way to view the effects of different integrators on a different system from what I and other groups had tried.
