Great presentations from everyone today. I also presented today so I won't comment on that.

Alyssa presented "Frequency-Domain Smoke Guiding". The results looked very good and they were able to achieve high-resolution-like results even though they used the low resolution to guide it.

It was nice to see the paper that fixes the inversion problem in FEM, though it was a little weird to have the objects completely flattened and emerge from a puddle. It showed the effects of elastic and semiplastic deformation on the rest pose very well.

It was cool seeing Nancy's own work in improving FEM. It was nice to go over the process of building  this and the results seemed very effective and easy to interact with. The deformation gave the objects a lot of character.
