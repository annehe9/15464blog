It was nice to go over Eulerian fluid simulation today. The dissipation effect does seem to be a particularly noticeable problem with smoke simulation, because we expect smoke to be very wispy and the energy conservation or lack of it is very apparent in the detail of the smoke. Compared to simulating water like in the water tank, it was a little harder to notice the differences and I could still convince myself that the different methods were realistic to some kind of fluid. Stylistically, I prefered FLIP because it had less particles splashed into the air, which seemed excessive in other models.
The APIC video did a good job of showing the differences between APIC, PIC, and FLIP.
